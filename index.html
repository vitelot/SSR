              A Sample Space Reducing (SSR) process is a stochastic process
              whose sample space reduces as it evolves in time.
              In its simplest version, imagine a set of N states in a system,
              labelled by i = 1, 2, ... , N.
              The states are ordered by the label.
              The only rule that defines the SSR process is that transitions
              between states may only occur from higher to lower labels.
              This means that transition from state j to i is possible only
              if label j > i. When the lowest state i = 1 is reached,
              the process is restarted.
              This simple dynamics leads to a Zipf’s law in the frequency
              of state visits, i.e. the probability to visit state i is given
              by p(i) = 1/i (with a slope corresponding to the red straight
              line in the plot below with circles).
              This scaling law is extremely robust and occurs for a wide class
              of prior probabilities.<br>
